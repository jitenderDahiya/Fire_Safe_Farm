Some crops need more minerals because they are damaged. They need these minerals to repair their stems, leaves or roots. Thus, farmers need to make sure nitrogen fertilizer, Phosphate fertilizer and potash.

Therefore, in order to let the left crops grow better, it’s suitable to clean these dead crops and leave more resource for the alive crops.

It’s worthwhile to keep these crops or not. To some extent, in this situation, the cost of repair may be higher than the cost of replant. As a result, we need to balance the cost
